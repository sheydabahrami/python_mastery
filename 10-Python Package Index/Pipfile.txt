06 Pipfile

When we install a package using pipenv, two files are automatically created.
Pipfile
Pipfile.lock

This two files are used to keep track of dependecies of our project and their version.

If we change to a different machine, with these two files just run the following command to install the packages and its dependecies
> pipenv install

If we want to install the exact same versions, versions we need to by pass "Pifile" and use "Pipfile.lock", with the following command:
> pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
