Hiding API Keys

In the previous lesson we stored ouAPI key in our code.
That's a bad practice, because if we publish our code to git this API key will be visible to anyone.
We should store our API Key in another file and exclude that file from git.

Add a new file "config.py" which will store all sort of configuraton parameters for our application, including the API Key
Then in our aplication we must import the "config" module and in the module we have an attribute call "api_key"

To exclude this file from git. Add a new file and call it ".gitignore".
There we can specify whats file and directories should be excluded from our git repository.
